                        - Confusing title?
                        - The Raising of Lazarus was one of Jesus' miracles
                            - Resurrected his friend Lazarus, who had been dead for four days
                        - In English-speaking countries, self raising flour, is flour with a leavening agent included
                        - Quote from Malcom Tucker, a sinister government spin doctor in The Thick of It
                        > What? Do you think I can't get it up anymore? Is that it?
                        > You're looking at fucking Lazarus, sweetheart.
                        > And not just plain Lazarus. I'm fucking self-raising Lazarus, right?
                        - So, I'm going out on a limb with a joke, which is really stolen from TV, and requires knowledge of gospel, bakery (in English!)
                        - But I always loved this quote, and I was reminded of it when thinking about how open source projects can survive a death
